# Project Description:

[FitCheck](https://fitness-check.netlify.app/) is an Instagram-style app that's all about fitness accountability. Users can create a profile and post fitness-related images with descriptions, tags, workout ratings, and difficulty ratings. The homepage feed displays all of the posts in chronological order, with the newest posts at the top. Each post displays the username of the user who posted it and the description they have written. When the user clicks on a post, they can see more details of that post, including tags and ratings.

We wanted to create an app that’s not just about scrolling through pictures, but about holding yourself accountable to your fitness routine, and gleaning inspiration from others’ posts. FitCheck is the only platform you need to keep your fitness in check!
